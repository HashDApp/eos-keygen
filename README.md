# eos-keygen
This is a minimal, easily auditable key generator for EOS. The only dependancy is the official eosjs-ecc library which is included from a public CDN. The IPFS hash of this html file is:

QmW4XxaEg8cWsYisfjnjqLFi1MbHMYjt7nbCh8ZHwgg9c2

So it can be safely accessed from any ipfs gateway, for example:

https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmW4XxaEg8cWsYisfjnjqLFi1MbHMYjt7nbCh8ZHwgg9c2
https://hardbin.com/ipfs/QmW4XxaEg8cWsYisfjnjqLFi1MbHMYjt7nbCh8ZHwgg9c2
https://siderus.io/ipfs/QmW4XxaEg8cWsYisfjnjqLFi1MbHMYjt7nbCh8ZHwgg9c2
etc.
